## Overview

The App is based on [Web Starter Kit](https://developers.google.com/web/starter-kit) boilerplate.
The app shows nearest pubs using data from foursquare API.


To install and run make
``npm install`` , ``gulp`` and run index.html from dist folder. 


## Quickstart
In oder to view nearest bars you should zoom in the map until 
a spinner appears in a page header.
After you will see some markers on the map. You can click on map markers and menu list items to show place details.
A filter on place names is also working.
#### Note
Requirements demand me to hardcode some data but it breaks a concept of this application. 
This app should dynamically load nearest places and later I will add functionality to observe who else can be looking for a bar near you.
